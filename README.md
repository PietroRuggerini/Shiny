For the assigment I've created a pretty simple survey, where you have to associate each erupean capital with the correct country. Click on "Submit!" when finished and see your final score, from 0 to 9. You can change your answers and retry as many times as you wish. 

The application uses 9 radio buttons (single choiche answers), arranged in 3 columns, using the "fluidPage" layout. On the Server side, a conditional operation is performed in a  reactive way and 1 point is assigned for each correct answer. Each time the button "Submit" is pressed, the calculation is performed again.
